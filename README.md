# FE16-CR02-MonaFahham

This project is a Food Blog webpage.
It consists of the Header part which contains the Logo, Recipe and the search icon. to Put them in a row, the Flexbox has been used(we can also use Grid and give the grid columns and rows and put each of the DIVs in a special grid column or row.)
The menu is a series of links which are set next to each other with the help of a Flexbox(also grid is possile)
The content consists of 9 images which in desktop breakpoint we have 3 images in each row, and in mobile breakpoint we have one image per row.
The footer also consists of 3 DIVs (footer menu, icons, copyright)
For each part of the project instead of FlexBox, it is possible to use Grid too.
